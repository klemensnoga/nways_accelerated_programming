    "Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) were initially designed to accelerate graphics processing, but in 2007 the release of CUDA introduced GPUs as General Purpose Processors. CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model that makes using a GPU for general-purpose computing simple and elegant. The developer still programs in the familiar C, C++, Fortran, or an ever-expanding list of supported languages and incorporates extensions of these languages in the form of a few basic keywords.\n",

    "- CUDA C/C++ is based on a standard C/C++, and CUDA Fortran is based on a standard Fortran\n",

    "**Heterogeneous Computing:** CUDA is a heterogeneous programming model that includes provisions for a CPU and GPU. The CUDA C/C++ programming interface consists of C language extensions, and the CUDA Fortran programming interface consists of Fortran language extensions. These enable you to target portions of source code for parallel execution on the device (GPU). CUDA provides a library of C/Fortran functions that can be executed on the host (CPU) to interact with the device. The two processors that work with each other are:\n",

    "# A Quick Recap\n",
    "We saw the definition of CUDA and briefly covered CUDA architecture and introduced CUDA C and CUDA Fortran constructs. We also played with block and thread configurations for a simple vector addition code. All this was done under the following restrictions:\n",
    "1. **Multiple Dimension**: We launched threads and blocks in one dimension. We have been using `threadIdx.x` and `blockIdx.x`, so what is `.x` ? This statement  says that we are launching threads and blocks in one dimension only. CUDA allows to launch threads in 3 dimensions. You can also have `.y` and `.z` for index calculation. For example, you can launch threads and blocks in 2 dimensions to  divide work for a 2D image. Also the maximum number of threads per block and number of blocks allowed per dimension is restricted based on the GPU that the code runs on.\n",
    "2. **GPU Memory**: What we have not covered is that GPU has different hierarchy of memory, e.g. GPU has a read only memory which provides high bandwidth for 2D and 3D locality access called _texture_. Also, GPU provides a scratch pad with limited memory called  _shared memory_\n",
    "3. **Optimization** : What we did not cover so far is the right way to access the compute and memory to get max performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "**One key characteristic of CUDA is that a user can control the access pattern of data for each thread. The user can decide which part of the memory the data can sit on.  While we are covering some part of this in this lab, which is required for us to port our code, we do not intend to cover all optimizations**"
